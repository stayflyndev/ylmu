var weak = [
    "We’re not alone. Not ever. God won’t let go, though we may struggle with the lies that He’s left us fending for ourselves in hard times. His Word is filled with reminders that He fights for us still today. “Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the LORD your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you.” Deut. 31:6", 

    "The enemy is not fighting you because you are weak. He is fighting you because you are STRONG!",

    "Remember that no problem is beyond the scope of God’s sovereign care for His children. He has promised to take care of us. Jeremiah 29:1 'For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.'",

    " For the Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He knows your going through this great wilderness. lThese forty years the Lord your God has been with you. You have lacked nothing.",

    "Suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope. And we know that for those who love God all things work together hfor good, for those who are called according to his purpose."

var fear = [
    "God is constantly working behind the scenes in every area of our lives, even when there is no tangible evidence to support that fact. Faith is a confident assurance in a God who loves us, who knows our thoughts, and who cares about our deepest needs. God is kind and understanding toward our weaknesses, but He requires us to go forward in faith, and the Bible is clear that faith does not mature and strengthen without trials.",

    "Adversity is God's most effective tool to develop a strong faith. as we learn to obey God's Word and allow it to saturate our thoughts, we find each trial becomes a stepping stone to a stronger and deeper faith. He sustained me in the past, He'll carry me through today and He'll uphold me in the future!",

    "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Philippians 4:7.",

var sad = [
    "“As for God, His way is perfect” (Psalm 18:30). If God’s ways are “perfect,” then we can trust that whatever He does—and whatever He allows—is also perfect. This may not seem possible to us, but our minds are not God’s mind. No greater suffering has ever been experienced than that of Jesus, a “man of sorrows and acquainted with grief” ",

    "Sadness is part of life, and it is not condemned. We are exhorted to see the greater reality of God’s plan even in the midst of our sadness and depression. Yes, this world is fallen and often painful. It can be depressing. But God is far greater. He is at work, victoriously. ",

    "There is no way that you can be feeling sad when you are giving thanks to God.  When we are rejoicing for all that God has done, we can’t be feeling sad because these two are polar opposites of one another. ",

    " Our pain ALWAYS has a purpose. Sometimes the purpose is to prepare us for some greater trial we will face down the road. We are not able to see the big picture in the way that God sees it. We see only the present pain, the sting of the needle. God is the parent who is with us in our suffering, yet also sees the end from the beginning in ways that we cannot fathom."

var stress = [
    "God is the God of peace (Romans 15:33; 1 Corinthians 14:33). Peace is a fruit of the Holy Spirit and something we can ask God for any time, having complete faith that He will answer our prayer.",
    "We are told to set our minds on the Spirit, because to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace (Romans 8:6). When we are feeling overwhelmed, it may also help to remove ourselves from the situation, if possible. We may need to decrease our workload, knowing that it is not sinful to let go of some responsibilities for a while",
    "Jesus teaches that our Heavenly Father knows our needs and cares about them. If God takes care of simple things like grass, flowers, and birds, won't He also care for people who are created in His image?",
    "Rather than worry over things we cannot control, we should 'seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things [the necessities of life] will be added to you' (Matthew 6:33). Putting God first is a cure for anxiety",
    "Are overwhelming circumstances causing anxiety? Have faith in God. As long as we are with Jesus, there is nothing to fear. Philippians 4:6, 7 instructs us to 'not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.'"

var anger = [
 "Anger is not always sin. For a victim to reach a place of true health and forgiveness, he or she must first accept the trauma for what it was. In order to fully accept that an act was unjust, one must sometimes experience anger. We can handle anger biblically by seeing God in the trial. Nothing happens to us that He does not cause or allow. Though God does allow bad things to happen, He is <u> always </u> faithful to redeem them for the good of His people.",

 "We can handle anger biblically by making room for God’s wrath.  Romans 12:19 both tell us to not play God. God is righteous and just, and we can trust Him who knows all and sees all to act justly",

 "We can handle anger biblically by returning good for evil.(Romans 12:21). This is key to converting our anger into love. As our actions flow from our hearts, so also our hearts can be altered by our actions (Matthew 5:43-48). That is, we can change our feelings toward another by changing how we choose to act toward that person.",

 "We must act to solve our part of the problem (Romans 12:18). We cannot control how others act or respond, but we can make the changes that need to be made on our part. Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him; do not fret when men succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes. (Psalm 37:7, NIV)",

   var jealousy = [
    "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. (1 Corinthians 13:4-5). Being jealous indicates that we are not satisfied with what God has given us. The Bible tells us to be content with what we have, for God will never fail or forsake us (Hebrews 13:5).",
   
    "There is nothing wrong with asking God for things we need and want in prayer, but we should ask with the firm belief that God knows exactly what we need and want and will provide for us according to His will. Being content with having our needs met in this life can go a long way in reminding us that this life is temporary and that the Kingdom of God is coming. Therefore, jealousy hinders the fruits of faithfulness and goodness.",
   
    "Again, remember that God wants to bless us and give us wonderful gifts, but only gifts that won’t be harmful for us. All good gifts come from God (James 1:17), so gifts that are going to be negative to our lives must come from someone else. Ecclesiastes 4:4,6 (GNTD)    I have also learned why people work so hard to succeed: it is because they envy the things their neighbors have. But it is useless. It is like chasing the wind…maybe so, but it is better to have only a little, with peace of mind, than be busy all the time with both hands, trying to catch the wind.",
   
    "It can be challenging to grab hold of rational thoughts and shove them into our brains to combat the irrational thoughts that have become comfortable. Focus on thankfulness. Rational thinking looks at what we have and is thankful and receptive of God’s blessings; irrational thinking looks at what others have and is spiteful and mocking of God’s blessings. Philippians 2:3 (GNTD)  Don't do anything from selfish ambition or from a cheap desire to boast, but be humble toward one another, always considering others better than yourselves.",
